# TySOM_3_ZU7_FMC2_LI_IMX274MIPI_FMC_V1_1

This platform utilizes [Leopard camera](https://leopardimaging.com/product/li-imx274mipi-fmc/) version v1.1 and allows grabbing frames from it and process on the board.

Because of the size of the platform it is available on [Aldec website](https://www.aldec.com/en/downloads/private/1189)

Note: This camera cannot be connected directly to the TySOM-3 board, special adapter Adapter_FMC_IMX274MIPI-TySOM-3 is required.
